# Phaser, React, TypeScript starter
![Screenshot of the starter](/docs/screenshot.png)

A [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) game project with a [React](https://reactjs.org/) overlay (for UI purposes). Powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) out of the box. Also includes some very basic interaction between the React UI and 
the Phaser game. Check out the live [demo](https://phaser-react-ts-starter.vercel.app/)!

## üöÄ Running
After cloning the repository, run the `yarn` command in the root directory to install all the required dependencies. If you're not using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (which you probably should), you can alternatively do this by running `npm install`.

Run the `yarn dev` command to start a developer server with hot reload. The npm alternative is `npm run dev`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Building
Build a production release of the project by running `yarn build` or `npm run build`. The built files are in the `dist` folder.
